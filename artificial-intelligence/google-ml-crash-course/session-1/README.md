# Session 1

## 1. Introduction to ML

### Practical Reasons for Mastering ML
1. Reducing time spent on programming (replace old-school style of coding: Rule of Thumbs)
2. Effective customization of products (migrate from one successful product to another)
3. Solving problems that cannot just be programmed

### Advices
- Running experiments and using **statistics**, not logic, to analyze results.
- [Rule #1: Don't be afraid to launch a product without machine learning](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml/#rule_1_dont_be_afraid_to_launch_a_product_without_machine_learning)

## 2. Framing

### Terminology
- Labels: variables we're predicting
- Features: input variables describing our data
- Models: maps examples to predict labels

## 3. Descending into ML

### Simplest Model - Linear Regression
